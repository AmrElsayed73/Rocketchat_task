Here i am going to Check the resources that i will create by making Terraform plan , then Terraform apply to run the deployment that will be in Run deployment file (2) at the same directory 

C:\Users\LMNX7392\Desktop\Terraform_lab\system_task>terraform plan
aws_security_group.allow_ssh: Refreshing state... [id=sg-007d69de017343706]
aws_instance.myecs: Refreshing state... [id=i-0d3a351474d5dbe86]

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.myecs will be created

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
